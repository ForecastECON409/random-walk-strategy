Test repo using the Random Walk as forecast technique. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Conda installed. If you don't have Conda, you can install either Anaconda or Miniconda from their respective websites.

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/ForecastECON409/random-walk-strategy.git
```

2. **Create Conda Environment**: Navigate to the project directory and create the Conda environment using the `econ409-env.yml` file provided in the repository:

```
cd path/to/project
conda env create -f econ409-env.yml
```

This command reads the `econ409-env.yml` file in your project directory, creating a new Conda environment with the name and dependencies specified in the file.

3. **Activate the Environment**: Once the environment is created, you can activate it using:

```
conda activate econ409-env
```

### Running the Project

After activating the environment, you can run the project's main scripts or start your development work.

### Re-activating Your Environment

If you return to this project at a later time and need to reactivate the environment, simply open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run:

```
conda activate econ409-env
```

This ensures that you are using the correct versions of the dependencies specified for this project.
